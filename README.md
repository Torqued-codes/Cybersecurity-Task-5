Cyber Security Internship Task 5 â€“ Wireshark Packet CaptureTask OverviewThis submission is for Task 5 of my Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship, which involves capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.Steps PerformedInstalled Wireshark on Windows and started a live capture on the Wi-Fi interface.Browsed websites and generated network traffic, allowing capture to run for about one minute.Filtered captured packets by protocol to identify key network protocols.Saved the capture file as .pcapng for analysis and submission.Key Protocols IdentifiedTCP: Provides reliable, ordered data transmission between network devices.ARP: Resolves IP addresses to physical MAC addresses within the local network.ICMPv6: Used for error messages and network diagnostics in IPv6 networks.DNS: Translates domain names to IP addresses for routing internet traffic.TLSv1.2: Encrypts and secures data for safe transmission over networks.Summary of FindingsObserved packet exchanges for different protocols including TCP handshakes, ARP requests, DNS queries, and encrypted traffic using TLS.Each protocol plays a critical role in supporting network communication and securing data.Files Includednetwork_capture.pcapng: Wireshark packet capture file.screenshot.png: Screenshot of Wireshark interface showing packet list.README.md: This summary and explanation document.
