# Cyber Security Internship Task 5 â€“ Wireshark Packet Capture :


## Task Overview : 

This submission is for Task 5 of my Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship, which involves capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.

## i] Steps Performed :

- Installed Wireshark on Windows and started a live capture on the Wi-Fi interface.

- Browsed websites and generated network traffic, allowing capture to run for about one minute.

- Filtered captured packets by protocol to identify key network protocols.

- Saved the capture file as .pcapng for analysis and submission.

## ii] Key Protocols Identified :

- TCP: Provides reliable, ordered data transmission between network devices.

- ARP: Resolves IP addresses to physical MAC addresses within the local network.

- ICMPv6: Used for error messages and network diagnostics in IPv6 networks.

- DNS: Translates domain names to IP addresses for routing internet traffic.

## iii] Summary of Findings :

- Observed packet exchanges for different protocols including TCP handshakes, ARP requests, DNS queries, and encrypted traffic using TLS.

- Each protocol plays a critical role in supporting network communication and securing data.

## iv] Files Included :

- network_capture.pcapng: Wireshark packet capture file.

- screenshot.png: Screenshots of Wireshark interface showing packet list.

- README.md: This summary and explanation document.
