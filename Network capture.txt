Identified Protocols:

1. TCP – Provides reliable data delivery for applications across the network.
2. ARP – Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for device communication in a local network.
3. ICMPv6 – Facilitates error messages and network diagnostics in IPv6 networks.
4. DNS – Converts domain names to IP addresses for network routing.
5. TLSv1.2 – Encrypts network communication to ensure secure data exchange.
6. QUIC - QUIC is a fast and secure transport protocol built on UDP that reduces connection latency. 

Observed Protocols: 

1. TCP – Provides reliable, ordered communication between networked devices.
2. ARP – Resolves IP addresses to physical MAC addresses for device identification.
3. ICMPv6 – Handles diagnostic messages and error reporting within IPv6 networks.
4. QUIC - Supports multiplexed encrypted streams, mainly used in HTTP/3 for improved web performance.
